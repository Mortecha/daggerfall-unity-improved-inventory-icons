# Daggerfall Unity Improved Inventory Icons

The goal of this mod is to replace all of the inventory icons with stylized equivalents. 

currently not 100% coverage 
- I need to work out how to make icons for equippable items represent the item instead of the paper doll representation being used as the inventory icon instead.
However, miscellaneous items and ingredients are covered for now.
- Some items use the same graphic so I'll need to figure out how to separate these. 

Ideally the replacements will match the originals but concessions will be made where appropriate. 
- Metals are now replaced with bars to match Skyrim for now, this may change as they may be represented by nuggets at a later date.
- Mercury is a liquid at room temperature so is shown in a glass vial instead of being represented as a nugget.
- Bloods are now shown in vials instead of as a blood smear, the colours of the blood may change for each creature the blood comes from at a late date. 

All current replacements are not set in stone and may change as the mod develops

Works very well when used ontop of D.R.E.A.M

If you would like to submit an imporved icon that fits the style, I'd gladly consider it and add it in.
